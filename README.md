# LibraMini
A JSON file that works for customization of the Libra Mini 40 keyboard with VIA


There is a lot of confusion when trying to change the keymap of the Libra Mini.
On Aliexpress you can find a lot of version that works with VIAL, VIA and QMK.

My keyboard didn't work with VIA only with VIAL.
I found a file and tinkered with it until it worked with VIA.
